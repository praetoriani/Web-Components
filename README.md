# Web Components

> [!NOTE]

<br>
Welcome to my <strong>Web Component Repository</strong>.
<br>
With this repository I would like to show how easy it is to create your own web components using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
<br><br>

### At the beginning a short introduction

In my opinion, we use complex frameworks like Angular, React or Vue far too often to develop web applications. But the truth is that in many cases we probably don't need it at all. Today's modern browsers come with a whole range of technologies that enable us to create our own web components using simple HTML, Javascript and CSS.
<br><br>
Now some people will probably ask themselves: <i>Why should I create my own web components?</i> or <i>What advantages do I have from this?</i> Basically, the advantages are actually obvious. Every time we use third-party technologies (such as frameworks etc), we make ourselves or our project dependent on these technologies.
<br><br>
It has now been over 20 years since I completed my professional training as a web developer. Back then, websites consisted of HTML, CSS and Javascript files. Since not only the Bowser, but also technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript have developed further over the 20 years, we now have completely different options.
<br><br>
Today we are able to define our own HTML components and style them independently of other components using our own CSS scope. We can also assign events to these components using Javascript and thus give them functionality. This allows us to create reusable web components that we can quickly and easily integrate into any of our projects.
<br><br>

### What do we need to create our own Web Components?

Actually, I have already answered this question in my short introduction. All we need to create our own web components is:
<br><br>
:pushpin: Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<br>
:pushpin: A modern web browser (e.g. Chrome)
<br>
:pushpin: A code editor (I use VS Code)
<br>
:pushpin: A local web server (I use the Node module http-server)
<br><br>
That's it.


### What's next?

As I said at the beginning, this repo is still under construction. There is currently only one example. But there will gradually be more. Examples of Web Components are located in the **Samples** folder. Each example has a <code>README.md</code> that includes some explanation about the Web Component Sample.

Feel free to download and play with the code example
