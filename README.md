### Welcome to my <strong>Web Component Repository</strong>.

With this repository I would like to show how easy it is to create your own web components using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
<br><br>

### At the beginning a short introduction

In my opinion, we use complex frameworks like Angular, React or Vue far too often to develop web applications. But the truth is that in many cases we probably don't need it at all. Today's modern browsers come with a whole range of technologies that enable us to create our own web components using simple HTML, Javascript and CSS.
<br><br>
Now some people will probably ask themselves: <i>Why should I create my own web components?</i> or <i>What advantages do I have from this?</i> Basically, the advantages are actually obvious. Every time we use third-party technologies (such as frameworks etc), we make ourselves or our project dependent on these technologies.
<br><br>
It has now been over 20 years since I completed my professional training as a web developer. Back then, websites consisted of HTML, CSS and Javascript files. Since not only the Bowser, but also technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript have developed further over the 20 years, we now have completely different options.
<br><br>
Today we are able to define our own HTML components and style them independently of other components using our own CSS scope. We can also assign events to these components using Javascript and thus give them functionality. This allows us to create reusable web components that we can quickly and easily integrate into any of our projects.
<br><br>

### What do we need to create our own Web Components?
<!--
Actually, I have already answered this question in my short introduction. All we need to create our own web components is:
<br><br>
:pushpin: Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<br>
:pushpin: A modern web browser (e.g. Chrome)
<br>
:pushpin: A code editor (I use VS Code)
<br>
:pushpin: A local web server (I use the Node module http-server)
-->
Here are my recommendations for the basic requirements and also information about the tools I use to create the web components.

<br>You should have at least a basic knowledge of HTML.
<br><br>

<br>Just like with HTML, you should also be familiar with CSS
<br><br>

<br>It is helpful if you know what classes and event handlers are<br>in JavaScript and if you know what DOM means.
<br><br>

<br>I've been using [ **VS Code** ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit my source code for many years.<br>But of course any editor works.
<br><br>
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Recommended%3A%20Chrome%20Browser-%23525252?style=plastic&logo=googlechrome&logoColor=%23DFDFDF&label=%20&labelColor=%23525252&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpraetoriani)
<br>I've also been using Google's Chrome browser for some time.<br>I mention this primarily for compatibility reasons
<br><br>
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Recommended%3A%20http%20server-%23525252?style=plastic&logo=npm&logoColor=%23DFDFDF&label=%20&labelColor=%23525252&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpraetoriani)

<br>To test my web components I mainly use the [ **http-server** ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (npm module).<br>But this also requires NodeJS. An alternative would be [ **ngrok** ](https://ngrok.com/), for example
<br><br>
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Recommended%3A%20NodeJS-%23525252?style=plastic&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=%23DFDFDF&label=%20&labelColor=%23525252&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpraetoriani)
<br>Even though I may not use [ **NodeJS** ](https://nodejs.org/en) that often, I still have it installed.<br>It was sometimes helpful to have it .
<br><br>
That's it :wink:	
<br><br>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> NodeJS is not required to create web components.

### What's next?

As I said at the beginning, this repo is still under construction. There is currently only one example. But there will gradually be more.
<br><br>
Examples of Web Components are located in the [ **Examples** ](https://github.com/praetoriani/Web-Components/tree/main/Examples) folder. Both the *Examples* folder and each example have a <code>README.md</code> which contains more detailed information.
<br><br>
Feel free to download and play with the code example

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is still under construction.
> More content is coming soon ...
