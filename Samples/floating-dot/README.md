## Web Component Sample: Floating Dot

This is a sample of a simple Web Component that shows a blue <i>floating dot</i> on your page.


**floating-dot.js**<br>
This file contains all the Javascript code that is necessary to define our component, assign a stylesheet to it and also give our component functionality.

**floating-dot.css**<br>
This is our external stylesheet, which is injected into our component via the asynchronous Javascript function <code>loadStyles()</code>


**floating-dot.html**<br>
Basically, this is just an HTML template that shows how to correctly integrate the component in order to use it.
