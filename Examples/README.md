### Welcome to the section: Examples


This <code>README.md</code> is an introduction to the section: *Examples*
<br><br>
The **Web Components Repository** contains the *Examples* folder. This folder. It contains examples of self-created web components. Each of these examples is located in a subfolder of the *Examples* folder. Each example consists of at least three files. An HTML, a CSS and a JS file. Graphics may also be used. If this is the case, they are also in the folder with the other three files.

Here you will find a list of the existing examples and a short explanation.
