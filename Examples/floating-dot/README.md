This is a sample of a simple Web Component that shows a blue <i>floating dot</i> on your page.

<br>

The *Floating Dot* has three files:
- <code>floating-dot.html</code><br>
  Basically, this is just an HTML template that shows how to correctly integrate the component in order to use it.
- <code>floating-dot.css</code><br>
  This is our external stylesheet, which is injected into our component via the asynchronous Javascript function <code>loadStyles()</code>
- <code>floating-dot.js</code><br>
  This file contains all the Javascript code that is necessary to define our component, assign a stylesheet to it and also give our component functionality.


<br>

Just look at the code, download the example and play around with it.
