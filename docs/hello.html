                    So you came here because you wanted some answers to certain questions. Questions like <i>What are Web Components?</i> and <i>How can I create Web Components?</i> or <i>Why should I use Web Components?</i>. And above all the question: <i>How can this website help me?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Well, I would like to take you on a little journey by telling you something about myself and this website. This is the best way for you to understand why this website exists and how it can help you.
                    <br><br>
                    But before we go into any more detail, you should know one thing:<br>
                    <strong>This website is made for Web Developers</strong>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Well, of course, everyone is welcome to have a look at this website. This website is about creating your own HTML components using HTML, CSS and Javascript. And that assumes that you have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. You should understand what the Document Object Model (DOM) is, what an HTML element is and how to define your own classes in Javascript.
                    <br><br>
                    But perhaps you are also a newcomer to the field of web development and are now inspired by this website to delve further into the subject. I can't teach you HTML, CSS and Javascript here, but I can show you what is possible with simple tricks. And in that case, I'm glad that I can inspire you.
                    <br><br>
                    But that's enough of an introduction. Here are the answers to a few questions.

                    I completed my professional training as a web developer over 20 years ago. Back then, web development was something different than it is today. We didn't have frameworks or modules/packages back then. Browsers were also not as technically advanced as they are today. A lot has happened in the field of web development over the years. However, I am quite skeptical about some of these developments. Why?
                    <br><br>
                    Every time we use external resources in one of our projects by using NodeJS modules or frameworks such as Angular, React, NextJS or Vue, we automatically make ourselves dependent on these technologies. We are dependent on them being developed further. And we now even have an abbreviation for this:<br>LTS (Long Time Support).
                    <br><br>
                    Call me old-fashioned, but I am of the opinion that you should always think carefully about whether, and above all on whom, you want to make yourself dependent. And personally, I always prefer to be independent if I have the opportunity to do so. But that doesn't mean that I don't like today's technologies. On the contrary. I work a lot with these technologies. But there is an alternative. And it's called Web Components.
                    <br><br>
                    This website and the associated Github repository are a private project of mine in which I have invested a lot of time, love and passion. And with this passion I would like to show you on this website how easy it is to create your own web components with a little HTML, CSS and some Javascript.

                    If you delve a little deeper into all the frameworks and take a look at the technology behind them, you will notice one thing quickly: Basically, a framework consists of a handful of web components and provides ready-made styling features including animations. And on top of that, you get various script libraries that provide you with an incredibly large collection of functions. The rest is just waving the magic wand a bit and dynamically manipulating the DOM behind the scenes.
                    <br><br>
                    To make all this possible, we need various modules and packages and have to enter commands in our command line. We need to look at the technology of the framework and much more. Oh yes, I almost forgot about that. Many technologies are so complex that the browser cannot understand them. So we need to “translate” our code again using interpreters. And then there is the question of code optimization. The end result is often unreadable code that looks like it was put in a blender. But as long as everything works, it doesn't matter what the code looks like. You can “recompile” the app at any time.
                    <br><br>
                    In my opinion, we often don't need all these technologies. Because we already have simple technologies that enable us to do many things even without complex frameworks. And this is exactly where web components come into play.

                    Essentially, web components are nothing more than independent, reusable HTML elements. We can define these web components with HTML, style them with CSS, and render them in the DOM with Javascript and assign functions to them. And once you understand how DOM manipulation works, the rest is really just native HTML, CSS and Javascript. So no more complex framework. No complicated entries on the command line. But the best part is: There is no need to compile your code at all, there are no more difficult build or deployment processes and no more interpreters are required.
                    <br><br>
                    Today's Browser (such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox) are modern web browsers that can interpret normal HTML, CSS and Javascript code. In general you can say that the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) creates the structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) define the look&feel of the page and the Javascript Code serves the functionalities. And all this is executed inside the Browser.
                    <br><br>
                    This is extremely helpful if you are a developer who creates web components. Becaue there is no need to install and run a local web server on your machine to host your files for testing. Your web browser can handle all the HTML stuff, your colorful CSS definitions and fancy animations, plus the super crazy Javascript, on its own.
                    <br><br>
                    Sounds great at first, right? Well, unfortunately there is a small catch. In order to become largely independent of all the frameworks and libraries as a web developer, you will need some time until you have your own collection of web components. And creating web components can be a complex process. Web components should be customizable in as many properties as possible. This not only increases the flexibility of the component itself, but also expands the possible uses. Especially when the components can be flexibly configured in layout/design. But there is also something positive about it. Once you have created two to three components, you can reuse most of your code. And then creating new components is pretty quick.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, you are never really alone within a community. So if you like my project and want to support me, we can build a community. And in this community we can publish our own web components and share them with each other.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, one more thing to say about this part:<br>I know there will be some skeptics who will now think, "<i>Yeah, sounds great. And in the end I'll have my own framework that no one but me understands.</i>". But this is not the case. You will learn something way better than creating your own Framework. You'll learn a development technique that will help you write highly flexible code that you can use anywhere. And to be precise: In the end, you actually only need a single Javascript file that can also inject possible CSS code. All your web components can be served with a single JavaScript file. The whole code in one file that you can deploy and use anywhere, anytime. And in the worst case, you only need to make adjustments to the javascript file to affect everything else. You no longer need to edit your HTML file or customize the CSS code. All you have to do is customize the Javascript code that will end up rendering everything for you.

                    <br><br>
                    I have created two extra areas on this website. In one section I will explain to you in detail and step by step how you can create your own web component. And in the other area you will find a few examples of web components that I created. This area is intended to serve as inspiration and show you what is possible.
